# âšª Ray Tracing in One Weekend

Learned the fundamentals of raytracing and computer graphics by creating my own raytracer using [Peter Shirley's guide](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). This includes...
- Positionable camera with Defocus Blur
- Materials (Diffused, Metal, Dielectrics)
- Antialiasing
- Spheres

Furthermore, the code has been rewritten using my knowledge of modern C++, aimed to make the code easier to read and harder to fail with modern keywords.

I've committed the Visual Studio project files for easy booting.
